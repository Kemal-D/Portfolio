      <description>A project to predict house prices with different features Investigated the dataset through descriptive analysis Exploratory analysis used to gain more insights on dataset Distrubution of the data is checked Different features are checked for correlation Missing data and outliers are investigated Transformed the data to normal distribution Generated new features Lastly regression model is trained with 80% variance.    Most Correlated Features with Sale Price     Predicted Prices vs Actual Prices     Heat map helps us observe the strongly correlated features.</description>

      <description>A project based on the recent spike in Covid-19 infections Accessed the most recent publicly available Covid-19 data Cleaned and prepared the data for further analysis Initial exploratory analysis is conducted Some findings include:    Countries with higest infection rate     Continents with highest deaths     Here we can see that the highest deaths occurred in the most populated continents. Whereas, countries which have lower GDP levels compared to first world countries such as USA, UK, Germany etc.</description>
